# Service Point Picker

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Sendcloud's Service Point Picker into a custom application.

Currently implements Sendcloud's v1.0 Service Point Picker Embed JS.

> ðŸ’¡Tip: read the [index.html](index.html) file source code.

## How to set up

- Enable Service Points in your Sendcloud's [API integration][docs-api-integration]
- [Play around with the live example][live-example]. When selecting a service point you'll receive a Service Point
  object and optionally a post number as the result.
- You'll need that data later when creating a new parcel through our Parcels API (see **Create new parcel** in [our api documentation][docs-parcel-api]).
- Make sure to fill in the `to_service_point` and `to_post_number` parameters when sending the data over.

## Further reading

Please refer to the [Service Points API documentation][docs-api-service-points]. There you can determine the list
of possible values to be used to [filter service points to certain carriers][live-example-carriers], for example.

## Officially supported browsers

- Edge (Blink, and Chromium)
- Firefox
- Chrome
- Safari

> Please not that service points **do not** support Internet Explorer
